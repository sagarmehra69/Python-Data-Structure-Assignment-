Python Data Structures Assignment
Overview

This repository contains my Python assignment focused on understanding and applying core Python data structures: List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. These structures are fundamental for efficient data storage, manipulation, and problem-solving in Python programming.

Objectives

1. Learn the properties and behavior of different data structures

2. Perform operations like indexing, slicing, iteration, and updating

3. Understand mutability and immutability concepts

4. Use dictionaries for key–value data handling and frequency counting

5. Apply string operations like split() and join()

Topics Covered

A) List

1. Creating lists

2. Indexing and slicing

3. Iterating using loops

4. Inserting and updating elements

B) Tuple

1. Tuple creation and access

2. Understanding immutability

3. Converting between tuple and list

C) Set

1. Creating sets

2. Removing duplicate values

3. Iterating through sets

4. Understanding unordered nature

D) Dictionary

1. Creating key–value pairs

2. Accessing values using keys

3. Iterating using items()

4. Merging dictionaries

5. Character frequency counting using dictionary

E) String Operations

1. Splitting string into list using split()

2. Joining list into string using join()

3. Converting characters to lowercase/uppercase

Key Learning Outcomes

1.Strong understanding of Python data structures

2.Ability to manipulate and process structured data

3.Improved problem-solving using dictionaries and loops

4.Foundation for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Development
