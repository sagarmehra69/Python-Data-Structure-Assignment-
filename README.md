# Python Data Structures for Data Analytics – Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my Python Data Structures assignment completed as part of my Data Analytics training. The focus of this assignment is to understand and implement Python's core data structures, which are essential for storing, organizing, and manipulating data efficiently.

Data structures are the backbone of data analytics, as they allow analysts to manage and process data effectively before performing analysis or visualization.
